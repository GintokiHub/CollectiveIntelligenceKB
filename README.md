Here you can find a curated and organized landscape of examples Collective Intelligence. For simplicity sake we'll define Collective Intelligence as 'processes and/or tools that facilate people to research, coordinate and produce together both on a small scale and potentially massive scale.' (This definition will be improved over time.) WikiPedia is an example of this, where a tool (the web platfrom) + (admittedly non-optiomal) processes (discussions, taking ownership) produce a source of knowledge that could not have been produced by any single individual or company.


Why is this important?
======================

With the complexity of society exploding, we cannot afford continuing without an ultra-efficient way of putting valuable human qualities, knowledge and skills to good use. We have many complex issues that need to be solved, requiring us to make though decisions and collaborating across many barriers including disciplines, nations, political inclinations and so forth. We also live in an age where we can produce and share information at an unprecedented scale, although the effectiveness with which we use this power leaves a lot of room to improve. With things as they are right now, we're still making bad decisions on every level and often struggle to organize ourselves well to create change. What if we could change this and create a society in which we can make informed and deliberate decisions, learn from the consequences of our actions and work together well on improving life for everyone together? Imagine goverments and companies that can really act in the best interest of everyone (including minorities) based on solid and transparent research? Imagine companies that can learn how to make the well-being of their stakeholders their firstmost priority, instead of hitting financial growth targets?

This is what you're looking at is about: getting an overview and ideas on how existing processes/tools are facilitating collective intelligence. My hope with this is that to inspire people to think what could happen as we develop in the direction of a Collectively Intelligent society. Also, the aim is to generate more awareness of the concept of Collective Intelligence, which doesn't nearly get as much attention as it should.


Contributing
============

You're looking at a project in its infancy. There's a lot of help needed to make concepts understandable, to research existing project and to organize the available information to be useful and easily navigable. Therefor, you are strongly encourage to contribute in every way you can, such as reporting errors and unclarities, suggesting new projects to add, etc. by adding issues and/or creating PRs. The long-term goal would be to enable people that aren't used to GitHub to contribute more easily, but for now I just want to see whether this project can be useful to anybody.


Structure
=========

Each project has a summary of interesting things it does, with discovered strengths and witnesses. The idea is to later make a more structured source of each individual interesting component, so we can make interesting overviews of different decision making processes, ways of gathering information, etc. Also, a good would be to include some idea of to 


Projects

To Be Done. As a quick start, here's some existing efforts I'd like to document:
